    <h2>Contribute to Go4lage</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We warmly welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute, please send us an email or open an issue on GitHub if you find a bug.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to fork the project and make your own modifications. However, we do conduct quality control for the main project. Some features are intentionally left out, especially those requiring proprietary elements, like shared login systems, and hot topics like email.</p>
    
    <p>Even projects that are also free and open source need to be reviewed. If they have a paid tier or a business connection, they may have a conflict of interest that affects their usefulness, even if it's not obvious at first glance. This is not a political stance; it's about maintaining code quality and keeping complexity low.</p>
    
  <h3>Planned Tasks and Ideas</h3>
  
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Server-side Rendering</h3>
      <p>We plan to enable Go4lage to serve server-side content with a cached template structure. However, we currently lack the experience to address SSR issues comprehensively. We'll tackle this later, once we have more insights.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>Go4lage should have a robust and well-designed testing workflow. Testing is crucial and should not be dictated by compliance alone.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Visuals</h3>
      <p>We need a better homepage and improved visuals. Our expertise in UI and UX is limited, and we would greatly appreciate any help in this area.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Performance Tests</h3>
      <p>Go4lage is expected to be fast enough for most applications, but stress testing is essential. We need to determine how many users it can serve with a fixed amount of computing power, under various scenarios. We also need to consider optimizations for NGINX, the compiler, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of running multiple databases with multiple instances needs evaluation.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Cache Optimization</h3>
      <p>We were unsure which Go cache library would best suit Go4lage, so we wrapped it to allow easy exchange:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code>type go4Cache struct {
    c cache.Cache
}</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>The task is to build a test suite and experiment with different cache libraries. If someone has prior knowledge of the best option, that would be great, but testing is still necessary.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>Documentation through examples is very effective. We could provide another example project. How about a nice to-do list app?</p>
    </li>
    
    <li class="task-item">
      <h3>Cache Extension to SQLC</h3>
      <p>Currently, users and groups are well-cached, but there's no cache layer for apps created with Go4lage. One possible approach is to fork or extend SQLC to integrate a cache layer, which would speed up production database calls. However, this would require additional work and RAM usage. This is a promising idea that needs a reality check.</p>
