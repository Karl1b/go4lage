  <h1>How to Create Your Backend</h1>
  <p>
    Initially, you must make an important decision: Do you require server-side
    rendering (SSR) or is client-side rendering (CSR) sufficient? Go4lage is
    already equipped for CSR. For SSR, while a template replacement is
    available, it may not include all the features you might need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Begin by designing your SQL data structure. Create a map of the information
    you intend to store in your backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examine the existing user, group, and permission structure. Avoid altering
    this and maintain the integrity of the domain. Instead, expand it by using
    their primary keys as foreign keys in your new tables. That is the idea of domain driven design. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With a Go backend, you can define and serialize complex queries using
    Golang. If your data spans three different tables, you can access it
    seamlessly and at extremely high speed. Therefore, focus on establishing a
    clear, simple, and logical structure in the database rather than prematurely
    concentrating on frontend views.
  </p>
  <p>
    After completing your data structure, write the SQL schema and queries. SQLC
    will generate useful functions for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proceed to write your endpoints. Implement your functions in the
    urls.go file. These functions will be called and will respond with JSON (for
    CSR) or HTML (for SSR).
  </p>
  <p>
    For static content, the template engine is already in place. Drop
    your files in the /root folder. By default, index.html is the starting point
    for users.
  </p>
  <h1>Go4lage build in commands</h1>
  <p>The following commands are wrapped or build in go4lage cli.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>startserver</li>
    <li>createsuperuser</li>
    <li>setupgp</li>
    <li>rungoose</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Startserver and createsuperuser are trivial, SetupGp will create Groups and
    permission on the fly so that the developer does not have to touch the admin
    dashboard for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rungoose runs, well goose, the db migration tool with
    "up","up-by-one","down","redo","reset","status","version","fix"
