  <h2>How to Create Your Backend</h2>
  <p>
    Initially, you must make an important decision: Do you require server-side
    rendering (SSR) or is client-side rendering (CSR) sufficient? Go4lage is
    already equipped for CSR. For SSR, while a template replacement is
    available, it may not include all the features you might need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Begin by designing your SQL data structure. Create a map of the information
    you intend to store in your backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examine the existing user, group, and permission structure. Avoid altering
    this and maintain the integrity of the domain. Instead, expand it by using
    their primary keys as foreign keys in your new tables. This approach aligns
    with domain-driven design principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a Go backend, you can define and serialize complex queries using
    Golang. If your data spans multiple tables, you can access it seamlessly and
    at high speed. Therefore, focus on establishing a clear, simple, and logical
    structure in the database rather than prematurely concentrating on frontend
    views.
  </p>
  <p>
    After completing your data structure, write the SQL schema and queries. SQLC
    will generate useful functions for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proceed to write your endpoints. Implement your functions in the urls.go
    file. These functions will respond with JSON (for CSR) or HTML (for SSR).
  </p>

  <h1>Go4lage Built-in Commands</h1>
  <p>The following commands are included in the Go4lage CLI:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>startserver</li>
    <li>createsuperuser</li>
    <li>setupgp</li>
    <li>rungoose</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The startserver and createsuperuser commands are straightforward. The
    setupgp command will create groups and permissions on the fly, eliminating
    the need for the developer to manually adjust the admin dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rungoose command runs Goose, the database migration tool, with options
    like "up", "up-by-one", "down", "redo", "reset", "status", "version", and
    "fix".
  </p>

  <h1>Serving Static Files</h1>
  <p>
    For static content, the template engine is already in place. Drop your files
    in the /root folder. By default, index.html is the starting point for users.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example demonstrates the simple Jinja syntax template used, as this
    documentation is served by Go4lage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The static files are loaded into the app's RAM at startup, ensuring fast
    serving times.
  </p>

  <h1>Package Management</h1>
  <p>
    Go is designed to have several small parts that each do one thing correctly.
    However, this is not always practical, and Go4lage extends this principle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go4lage itself should be the main package, and your endpoints will be in a
    new package that is imported into the main package.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is another package, utils, that exists to avoid cyclic dependencies.
    (You will probably need the UserKey struct from it to get your user from the
    request context.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite using your own package for your main changes and mostly modifying
    only urls.go, you still need to use the sql/schema and sql/queries folders.
    Again, it is recommended not to alter the existing structure and to make
    only additive (domain-driven) changes.
