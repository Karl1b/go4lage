  <h1>Recipe CV Assistant with AI</h1>

  <p>
    As an example of how to use Go4Lage, I present my entry to the Google Gemini
    AI Challenge. The task was to create a web application that utilizes the
    Gemini AI API.
  </p>

  <p>My entry achieves the following:</p>

  <p>
    The user uploads their CV or CV draft in PDF or Text format. The application
    then:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Determines the candidate's region (US or Germany) to tailor its
      calculations
    </li>
    <li>Analyzes the performance of the current CV</li>
    <li>Launches several agents to improve the CV</li>
    <li>
      Reanalyzes the various CV versions and provides the user with the best
      version to maximize their yearly salary
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This process allows the user to receive an optimized CV, saving time and
    effort, and potentially achieving a salary increase of 5-10%.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used this project to test my initial design of Go4Lage, fixing small bugs
    and addressing unforeseen issues. While the project was meant to be a test,
    it proved to be more enjoyable and rewarding than expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    The development process was fast and straightforward, with minimal attention
    required for bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is a performant application with minimal vendor lock-in, apart
    from the Gemini AI for now.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only significant dependency is the Gemini AI API, which was part of the
    task. However, I encapsulated it in a custom wrapper, making it
    interchangeable with other LLM APIs, including free options like Ollama.
    While this may not align with Google's expectations, a development challenge
    must accept outcomes that may question the value of a specific business
    model.
