  <h2>Groups and Permissions</h2>

  <p>In go4lage the groups and permissions are simple strings.</p>
  <p>
    Users have groups and groups have permissions. A group is also a permission
  </p>
  <p>If you have a simple app then using only groups might be good enough.</p>

  <pre><code>go
  r.Use(app.AuthMiddleware("staff", "")) 
</code></pre>

  <p>
    In this example every user that has the group "staff" can use the endpoint.
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <pre><code>go
  r.Use(app.AuthMiddleware("controller", "can_do_something")) 
</code></pre>

  <p>
    In this example every user with the group "controller" can access the
    endpoint, AND every user with the permission "can_do_something"
  </p>

  <p>
    Also normal users have to be set to active. Superusers can always access
    everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to go more complex you can add the permissions also to groups.
    For this you can code this in setup.go there is an example provided. Or you
    can manage this manually later via the admin dashboard gui.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to implement permissions on specific db objects you need to
    implement your own checks
