  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What does Go4lage mean?</td>
      <td>
        Go4lage is a play on words. 'Vorlage' (4lage) is German for template, so
        it could roughly be interpreted as 'GoTemplate.'
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Will there ever be Redis support?</td>
      <td>
        Redis support is not planned as Go offers a more native caching
        solution. Alternatively, you can use Postgres in memory mode for SQL
        features.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is Go4lage really free?</td>
      <td>
        Yes, Go4lage is free both as in free speech and as in free beer, even
        for commercial use.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How can I contribute?</td>
      <td>Please refer to the official GitHub repository for details.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why is 2FA available for superusers but not for normal users?</td>
      <td>
        2FA requires a well-thought-out setup. It involves more than just
        providing a key secret to users. To secure your app effectively, proper
        planning is necessary. If you consider this, you will be able to
        configure Go4lage accordingly.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I come from Django (Python), is Go hard to learn?</td>
      <td>
        Not at all. Only the initial steps might seem challenging. Golang values
        simplicity and is often more straightforward than Python because it
        avoids unexpected complexities.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why is there no ORM?</td>
      <td>
        ORMs introduce an unnecessary layer of complexity. We believe in
        starting with the data you want to manipulate, as the most important
        aspect of information technology is the data stored in the database.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Why is the JS build included and tracked?</td>
      <td>
        This build was included to allow users to avoid building it themselves.
        Many might not need to touch it at all.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How powerful (fast) is Go4lage?</td>
      <td>
        Although there are no real-world tests published yet, Go applications
        are generally fast enough. The main appeal of Go is not just its speed
        but its simplicity and the ability to write concurrent code, which aids
        in rapid development and producing robust code that can adapt to future
        requirements.
