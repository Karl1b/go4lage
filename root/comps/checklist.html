  <h2>Is Go4lage the perfect match for your project?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Team dynamics:</strong> You have a collaborative, agile team of
      3-5 developers who can make decisions quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Infrastructure control:</strong> You prefer the freedom of
      self-hosting your backend (cloud services like Firebase, Azure, or AWS are
      possible but don't work out-of-the-box).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical competence:</strong> You're willing to work with Golang
      and SQL, with general programming proficiency being more important than
      prior experience with these specific technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modern architecture:</strong> Your app benefits from a headless
      backend approach (CSR - Client Side Rendering).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scalable focus:</strong> Your app serves a targeted user base
      under a quarter million, not requiring complex global infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Content discovery:</strong> Go4lage is perfect if your app doesn't
      rely on SEO or Google discoverability for success.
    </li>
  </ul>
