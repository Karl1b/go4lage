      <h2>Example Cost Calculation</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="cost-calculation">
        <p>Server costs are an essential consideration for any business. Here's a realistic cost breakdown for a typical setup:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Main server: €10 to €25 per month (including domain)</li>
          <li>Test server: €10 per month (including domain)</li>
          <li>Email service: €10 to €15 per month</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Total estimated cost: <strong>€30 to €50 per month</strong></p>
    
        <p>This setup includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A production server</li>
          <li>A test system mirroring the latest updates</li>
          <li>Version control (free for up to 5 users on GitHub)</li>
          <li>Reliable email service</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Go4lage's efficient design allows for easy scaling with Docker Compose, potentially keeping costs stable even as you grow to serve multiple customers with separate instances.</p>

      <table class="faq-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Question</th>
          <th>Answer</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>What does Go4lage mean?</td>
          <td>Go4lage is a play on words. 'Vorlage' (4lage) is German for template, so it roughly translates to 'GoTemplate.'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Will there be Redis support?</td>
          <td>Redis support is not planned. Go offers native caching solutions, and Postgres can be used in memory mode for SQL features if needed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Is Go4lage really free?</td>
          <td>Yes, Go4lage is free both as in "free speech" and "free beer," even for commercial use.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>How can I contribute?</td>
          <td>Please refer to our <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/go4lage" target="_blank">official GitHub repository</a> for contribution guidelines.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Why is 2FA only available for superusers?</td>
          <td>Implementing 2FA requires careful planning. Go4lage provides the foundation, allowing you to configure it according to your specific security needs.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Is Go hard to learn for Django (Python) developers?</td>
          <td>While initial steps might seem challenging, Go values simplicity and is often more straightforward than Python, avoiding unexpected complexities.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Why is there no ORM?</td>
          <td>We believe ORMs add unnecessary complexity. Go4lage focuses on direct data manipulation, prioritizing the most crucial aspect of IT: the data stored in your database.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Why is the JS build included and tracked?</td>
          <td>The JS build is included to simplify setup for users who may not need to modify it, allowing for easier deployment out of the box.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>How performant is Go4lage?</td>
          <td>While specific benchmarks are not yet published, Go applications are generally very fast. Go4lage's main strengths lie in its simplicity, concurrency support, and ability to produce robust, adaptable code.</td>
